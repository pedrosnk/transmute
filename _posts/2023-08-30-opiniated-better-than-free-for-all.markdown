## TL;DR

Recently I heard someone saying that it is impossible to implement
a code style guide on his company codebase because there's a lot of
engineers with strong opinions, and they never agree oever an argument.
While I agree that engineer have strong opinios, there are too many
benefcits in an style guide in a code base are easialy perceived during
the daily work. We need to starting letting go our personal opinions and
just agree to disagre and move on.

## The problem

The challenge at hand revolves around implementing a code style guide 
within the company's codebase. This issue has arisen due to the
existence of a multitude of engineers, each possessing strong and
often conflicting opinions. This diversity in viewpoints has led
to a significant barrier when attempting to reach consensus on coding
standards and practices. The result is an ongoing inability to 
establish a unified code style guide for the organization's projects.

## Example

To illustrate the problem, consider a scenario where engineers within
the company are working on a collaborative Ruby project. In this project,
there is no cohesive code style guide in place, resulting in
different team members submitting code contributions with inconsistent
formatting, variable naming conventions, and overall structure.

```ruby
# Inconsistent Variable Naming
user_name = "Alice"
usr_age = 30

# Lack of Consistent Indentation
def calculate_total(items)
  total = 0
    items.each do |item|
    total += item[:price]
    end
  total
end

# Mixed Quoting Styles
puts 'This is a message with single quotes.'
puts "And this is a message with double quotes."
```

This lack of coding consistency not only hampers code readability but
also leads to prolonged code reviews and makes it challenging for
new team members to quickly adapt to the codebase. A standardized
code style guide would mitigate these issues and contribute to a
more streamlined development process.

## Solution

Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach.
First, acknowledging the value of a code style guide in promoting
maintainability, readability, and collaboration is crucial. Instead
of enforcing a single rigid style, adopting a flexible code style
guide that accommodates various preferences while maintaining
core guidelines is the key.

Fostering open discussions to emphasize the benefits of a
unified code style guide can help engineers recognize the advantages
that outweigh personal preferences. Encouraging a culture of
compromise and acknowledging that diversity in opinions can enrich
coding practices is paramount. Furthermore, introducing automated
code formatting tools can play a pivotal role in alleviating the
burden of manual adherence to style guidelines, thereby reducing
time-consuming debates over formatting choices. By focusing on
shared benefits, promoting open dialogue, and leveraging automation,
it's possible to strike a balance between individual preferences
and collaborative coding standards, ultimately enhancing overall
development efficiency.
